# MiniTomatos
Statistical data of mini tomatos - R Examples

## Box 1

Box one was a opened box of mini tomatoes of which some tomatoes have been already eaten. Only 40 tomatos were left.

Every tomato was weighted with an uncalibrated digital kitchen weighbridge with a precision of 0.001 kg. That's very inaccurate for objects weighing only 0.004 to 0.013 kg.

The total of the weight was 0.300 kg. All 40 tomatoes together weighed 0.2885 kg. (The digital display would change periodically between 288 and 289.) This difference is due to the accuracy of the scale.

We get a more accurate average weight of 0.0072 kg by dividing 0.2285 through 40 than by calculating then average from the sum of the single tomatos.
