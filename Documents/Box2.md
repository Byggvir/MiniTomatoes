Statistical data of mini tomatos - R Examples

## Box 2

Box two was a closed box of mini tomatoes. The box contained 58 tomatoes.

Every tomato was weighted with an uncalibrated digital kitchen weighbridge with a precision of 0.001 kg. That's very inaccurate for objects weighing only 0.004 to 0.013 kg.

The sum of the single weights of 58 tomatoes was 0.476 kg. One tomato drop left out. All 59 tomatoes together weighed 0.490 kg. This difference is due to the accuracy of the scale.

We get a more accurate average weight of 0.0081 kg by dividing 0.490 through 59 than by calculating then average from the sum of the single tomatos (0.0082 kg).
