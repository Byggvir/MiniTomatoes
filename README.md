# MiniTomatos
Statistical data of mini tomatos - R Examples

I measured mini tomatos and collectes the following data

* weight
* length
* diameter (max)

In the **data** directory are *ODS* and *CSV* files with the collected data.
In the **SQL** directory are the *SQL* scripts needed to import the data into a MySQL, MariaDB or SQLite database. It may be that they work with PostgreSQL, but I didnÂ´t test it.

In the **R** directory are the scripts to analyse the data.
